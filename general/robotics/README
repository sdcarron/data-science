This contains files (no code) displaying the performance of code I wrote for a robotics AI course in studies at GA Tech.

(1) This file displays the performance of the Kalman Filter code. This code accomplished 2 objectives
(A) This code implements a Kalman Filter, which is used in the task of monitoring and predicting the location of asteroids within the asteroid field
(B) This code uses the results from implementing the Kalman Filter to inform the ship in how to navigate through the asteroid field


(2) This file displays the performance of the Particle Filter code. This code accomplished 2 objectives
(A) This code implements a Particle Filter, which is used in the task of identifying the glider location within the boundaries of the map
(B) This code uses the results from implementing the Particle Filter to steer the glider to a specified target, after the glider is localized
